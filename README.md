BMP Manipulator:
================

I made BMP Manipulator for my Diploma final year project. In this project, a BMP is manipulated in bit level. Using BMP Manipulator, you can do the following operations.

Features:

* It can export BMP header from a BMP file.
* It can color intensity i.e. RGB HEX values as text from a BMP file.
* It can convert a BMP to show it through text editors like notepad using ASCII characters.
* It can convert back color intensity .hex file to .bmp file.
* It can rotate a BMP image by 90, 180, and 270 degrees clockwise.
* It can segmentize a BMP image i.e. breaking a BMP image containing text to smaller images line-by-line, and again word-by-word.
* It can apply median blur effect on a BMP.
* It can generate histogram of any BMP image in PGM format.
* It can resize any BMP image.
* It can binarize any BMP image.
* It can crop-out BMP images i.e. extracting the core part of a BMP image.
* It can perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on BMP images.
